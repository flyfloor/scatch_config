# Semi-Sublime

SublimeText 3 plugin for [Semi](https://github.com/yyx990803/semi) - automatically adds/removes semicolons from JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed!
2. If your `node` executable is not in default $PATH, you might have to manually set your `node` path: Preferences -> Package Settings -> Semi -> Node Path.

- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `A` = Add Semicolons!
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `R` = Remove Semicolons!
- (On Windows/Linux, replace `Cmd` with `Ctrl`.)
